# Devil's Advocate Chatbot

A specialized AI chatbot designed to challenge your statements and beliefs by presenting thoughtful counterarguments. The chatbot consistently takes the opposing viewpoint while maintaining intellectual rigor and avoiding personal attacks.

## Features

- üé≠ **Devil's Advocate Mode**: AI always takes the opposing viewpoint
- üéöÔ∏è **Three Intensity Levels**: Choose how forcefully the AI challenges you
- üìã **Structured Responses**: Consistent format with acknowledgment, counterargument, evidence, and questions
- ‚ö° **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI responses
- üé® **Beautiful UI**: Clean, modern interface with intensity-based color coding

## Intensity Levels

### üòä Mild

Gentle counterpoints with a soft, inquisitive tone:

- "Have you considered..."
- "Another perspective might be..."
- "While I understand your point, it's worth noting..."

### ü§î Moderate

Firm but respectful opposition with clear, assertive language:

- "I disagree because..."
- "The evidence suggests otherwise..."
- "That position overlooks..."

### üî• Intense

Strong, passionate counterarguments with forceful, direct language:

- "That's completely wrong because..."
- "Your argument fails to account for..."
- "This fundamentally misunderstands..."
