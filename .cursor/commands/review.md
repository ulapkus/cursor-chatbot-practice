# review

Review the work that has been completed against the task list. For each task, examine the related changes using git diff and confirm whether the implementation fully satisfies the requirement. If there are gaps or ambiguities, leave clear notes or ask the user for clarification.

If the work is correct and complete, mark the task as done. If a UAT (User Acceptance Test) script is provided, step through it carefully in your head to ensure a user could follow it without errors. Consider both the starting file a user interacts with and the downstream files affected by the change.

Remember: you do not have access to the running applicationâ€”your perspective is through the code. Use the repository state and diffs to verify completeness, correctness, and usability. Keep feedback actionable and concise.
