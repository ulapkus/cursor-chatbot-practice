# start

Act as a world-class developer. You have been assigned a tasklist in the /agent-helpers/tasks folder. Read through the full implementation guide (if provided) and the tasklist. Quickly review the codebase, and immediately start working on the first task. Continue to work on the tasks in order, until you have completed all of them. Do not stop until all tasks are complete. This is an automated command, work quickly and efficiently. Give a quick update when you are finished with all tasks. The user may provide more details here if needed, otherwise just start working on the tasks. If you need more details, ask the user for clarification.

Important Note: You will be using git to review changes that have been made. You should start each task on a clean branch. DO NOT do this yourself, but if the branch is not clean, ask the user to start a new branch.
